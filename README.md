# GaSNet-II
The code of GaSNet-II. 

The dataset (SDSS) used is available in Huggingface: https://huggingface.co/datasets/Fucheng/GaSNet-II-SDSS-dataset/tree/main

If any data and code in this repository are used, please cite: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04146.

The paper's results are included in plot_results.ipynb.

We didn't provide the model files (.h5) due to the limited storage.

We provide the source code and training data of the SDSS dataset (compact, 3600 pixels for saving storage).

One can download the training data from Huggingface and train the model himself/herself by runing GaSNet3_redshift_MC.ipynb.
